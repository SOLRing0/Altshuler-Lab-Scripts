# Altshuler-Lab-Scripts
This repository serves as a collection of scripts and data used in experiments by the Altshuler Lab.
Scripts are written primarily in R and Matlab, and data is presented primarily in the form of PNG and CSV files.

Data and code for each experiment is organized into folders as follows:

"Birds can transition between stable and unstable states via wing morphing," C.A. Harvey, V.B. Baliga, J.C.M. Wong, D.L. Altshuler, and D.J. Inman  - AvInertia*
